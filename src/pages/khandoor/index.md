Ok so funny story. So a couple of years ago I when the very first inkling of an idea about becoming a developer came into my head I needed to create a Github account. I spent about 5 minutes and came up with this idea of blending my last name with my favorite rock band and Khandoors was born. Ever since then I became more and more enamored with the creation.
