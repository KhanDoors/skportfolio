Ok so funny story. So a couple of years ago I when the very first inkling of an idea about becoming a developer came into my head I needed to create a Github account. I spent about 5 minutes and came up with this idea of blending my last name with my favorite rock band and Khandoors was born. Ever since then I became more and more enamored with the creation. I started to read into the name more and more and felt it was really appropriate for the kind of developer I wanted to be. A condor is a vulture and does whatever it can to survive. If I was going to make it as a developer I was going to need that kind of grit. I was going to have to humble myself and scrap as hard as I could to survive as a developer. I was going to study every lesson, build every project and do whatever I could to learn everything I needed. So that's what i did, I became the Khandoor. A Khandoor is a developer that does everything they can to learn their craft. A Khandoor makes whatever sacrifices they need to to be a great developer. I don't watch a lot of T.V., I don't go out much, I code and code and code. I used to be a huge sports fan, not so much anymore. When I have free time I code, when I am tired I code, when I'm tired of coding I code some more. I do that because I want coding to be as natural as eating or breathing. That is who and what a Khandoor is.
