What does it take to be a Full Stack Developer? Man, as I travel this path I have come to realize that it takes quite a lot. It's not just learning Javascript(or whatever language you choose) and a database and HTML and CSS and Express and Node. What about image manipulation raster and SVG? Deployment? Version control? SEO? There are so many different areas that need to be covered. This stuff is really hard to master in a vacuum. I think it is super important to learn how to live in the developer community and learn from others. Even if you are going the Bootcamp route, it is not enough. It takes many many hours of writing programs from scratch to deployment. Along the way you encounter so many issues that cause you stumble that you need the communities help in order to overcome them. I can't imagine learning to be a developer of any kind without that community help.
