Robotic Process Automation or RPA is a technology that allows a computer program or robot to replicate otherwise manual processes done by humans in an automated repeatable and reliable manner just like a human. Robots are best suited for tasks that are repetitive rule based and incorporate structured digital data in the workplace or is used to automate labor intensive day to day processes freeing up high value employees time for activities such as problem solving exception handling and troubleshooting a few real life examples where RPA could be used in a bank would be payment processing invoice management reporting and reconciliation.

The UI path RPA platform consists of three main components.

Studio, Robot and Orchestrator:

1. Studio is a highly visual intuitive automation tool with process recorders and pre-built drag and drop activities that enable people without developer skills to quickly create or appear work-flows. So in simple English it is a GUI desktop application which is the integrated development environment or the idea where developers build the robots.

2. Robots. Robots or software workers that run the automation is created in studio you are part robots. That's every business process you get attended and you get unattended robots attended robots directly assist employees triggered by human commands while unattended robots run back office tasks and work autonomously in a physical or virtual environment.

3. Orchestrator is an intelligent console that deploys robots schedules work and report on performance so simply put it is a web application and it is also a mobile application so you can deploy schedule and manage robots from anywhere.
