Robotic Process Automation or RPA is a technology that allows a computer program or robot to replicate otherwise manual processes done by humans in an automated repeatable and reliable manner better than a human. Robots are best suited for tasks that are repetitive rule based and incorporate structured digital data in the workplace or is used to automate labor intensive day to day processes freeing up high value employees time for activities such as problem solving exception handling and troubleshooting. A few real life examples where RPA could be used in a bank would be payment processing invoice management reporting and reconciliation.

The UI path RPA platform consists of three main components.

Studio, robot and orchestrator:

1. Studio is a highly visual intuitive automation tool with process recorders and pre-built drag and drop activities that enable people without developer skills to quickly create or appear work-flows. So in simple English it is a GUI desktop application which is the integrated development environment or the idea where developers build the robots.

2. Robots. Robots or software workers that run the automation that is created in the studio. Business process you get are either attended or unattended robots. Attended robots directly assist employees triggered by human commands while unattended robots run back office tasks and work autonomously in a physical or virtual environment.

3. Orchestrator is an intelligent console that deploys robots, schedules work and report on performance. Simply put it is a web application and it is also a mobile application so you can deploy schedule and manage robots from anywhere.

4/13 2nd day
So I've been using UiPath for 2 days now and I absolutely love it. I see the power it has and I can't believe I am going to have a chance to run with this. I definitely see the future right here right now. This is the way forward.

So the first thing was messing around with the program itself. All in all not too complicated. I went through all the functionality of it and I think I have a good understanding of it. Also open, closing and saving files within the program is always a little different application to application. This looks like a program that is still in its infancy though. The program is clunky and blocky, there is stickiness to it. It is not as slick as maybe VS Code. However, I love what the program does! The robots are coming .. check that, the robots are here and I create them. They will be my children.

So the first project I messed around with a sequence and within that was a simple open application box which => opened the Notepad application => typed in some text, ran it and that was it. I was impressed with the speed of the sequence of events. That jumps out at you right away how fast it processes the robot even on my dinosaur of a computer.. no offense computer, i love you. There is no code per se but it is built on Visual Basic so there is that syntax to learn but it is programming so language is language not a big deal, thanks Brad Traversy.

The second project was quite a bit more complicated. I scraped Google and extracted some weather data. I got a basic understanding of Sequences again, web scraping, flowcharts and dialog box / message box's. Flowcharts were a blast man i really enjoyed that. I will definitely be doing a lot more of that in the future. I did find one quark with the program: Mt robot wouldn't run after it had been running fine. When I debugged it I found the one of the previously verified variables had an error in the field and had to be reentered. I can't say how that happened as I said it was set right and had worked previously. It is something I am keeping an eye on as it may have been my fault or a bug. All in all a great second day. I even found time to have dinner with the family.

4/14 day 3
Ok
The day is not done yet but I wanted to get an entry in. So this morning I built a robot which took data from an excel spreadsheet and populated a web app with set fields. So i grabbed the 100 entries from the excel spreadsheets and placed them in the different fields in the web app, it took about 3 minutes (the final robot, not building it, building it took about an hour), which I think is pretty good. Some of the things that made it interesting was setting delays, simulating button clicks, emptying fields and a few other things. All in all I'm finding this pretty easy.

I had to take some time off the watch Tiger win his 5th Master's title, which was amazing. I don't like taking time off from coding but that was worth it! I will try to reengage in a little while.
