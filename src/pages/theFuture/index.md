When we talk about the future of coding and technology I would like to start with this site. This site incorporates many of the new technologies that are really shaping the future of development. It's built using Gatsby which is turn uses React, Redux, Graphql, Express, Node and a host of other amazing techs. This Blog is written using a markdown file. The Portfolio is hosted on a CMS, Contentful. The site itself is hosted on Netlify. The way these techs mesh with one another is truly part of the magic of what the future holds, small powerful parts coming together to form an exponentially more impressive collective. Where this goes in the future is really hard to determine but we know it will be a lot of fun.

The question that gets asked a lot, is who other than hobbyists is going to use these techs. A corporate entity will not take the chance on emerging techs that may or may not last. I think that line of questioning misses the point. It's not about using this in a production environment, for me its about seeing what's possible and honing my developer skills. Learning how to use these different techs and fitting them together like puzzle pieces gives me a greater understanding of what coding is. In the coding world it is never about one thing. One tech accomplishes only one thing and that's limiting. I don't want to be just a DBA or a front-end dev, I want to use a database with a server and front end libraries and build something awesome. I do believe we are heading straight into a technological revolution that will begin and end with the programs that we can write. Hardware has not stopped improving since the beginning of time but the amount of brains we can add to machines has only just begun.

I think a lot of us writing code these days understand that what we are doing is tantamount to cave drawings compared to what will happen in the next 10-15 years. By the time our kids grow into this they will be writing programs in grade school that will make our best look simplistic. That is the way of most technological things. We all know where this is heading though, AI, Machine Learning, Data Science and more. These fields hold such amazing potential we won't recognize out species in 20 years.

Is AI and the like scary? I love that question, when I hear it I know a cool conversation will follow. I am personally not afraid of machine intelligence. AI is just another tool that will inevitably have some bad people behind it and no amount of regulation will stop bad actors from doing bad things. There will, however, be an a vanguard on the other side comprised of great scientists and engineers and white-hat hackers and hobbyists who have the ability to influence the outcome. We will also be writing programs and tools to keep the masses free from Terminatoresque scenarios. I personally believe there is much more fun to be had than there is apocalyptic scenarios. That is where I am personally headed as a developer and I am sure many others are as well.
